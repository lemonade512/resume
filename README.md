# Personal Resume
This repository contains my personal resume. It is super easy to build:

    $ pdflatex resume.tex

I try to keep this updated at least once a year, and more often if I remember.

# Installing pdflatex for MacOS
Install mactex via Homebrew to gain access to the pdflatex command on mac.

    $ brew cask install mactex

# Ubuntu
Ubuntu uses the `texlive` library for running the `pdflatex` command. Install
`texlive` with the following command:

    $ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base
